	      <br />
	      Hey Love Bug,
      	<p>
					I know I’m not so good at writing elaborate poetry, wooing you with flowers
					or showering you with gifts. So for you this Christmas I wanted to create 
					something special for my Kim to let her know she is the most lovely, caring, 
					kind hearted bambus-bear chen that I know. I wanted to create Kim a very personalised 
					something that has Bede written all over it. So I decided to learn how to create 
					a website (believe it or not, I haven’t actually had much exposure to creating 
					websites!) and make it for Kim.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have gathered photos and written down my recollections of lots of good 
					times we have had together. There were a lot! So on this website are a few 
					of my most favourite memories. I am very aware that I heaps of the good times 
					we have had aren’t on the website but its okay - we remember them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well bug I shall let you peruse your one and only website at your leisure. 
					This is all for my loveliest girlfriend, using the best way I could think of to 
					show my love for you and my appreciation all the happiness you have brought to not 
					only me but everyone around you. You are my Squashy Hedgehog, my Love bug, my 
					Bambus-bear chen, my one and only Kimberley.
				</p>
					<br/>Love you,
